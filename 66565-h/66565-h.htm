<h2 class="nobreak" id="FORWARD">A FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>Sending this little book out into the world is
like sending out one of my children, for as they
came from my heart, so has it. My heart has
ached for my children as it has been necessary for
them to go out and meet the buffetings of an unsympathetic
world and so aches it for this little
fledgling. But still I have a hope that the world
will not be wholly unkind to it and that it will
find its place and accomplish that which has been
hoped for it, in helping human lives and adding to
the sum of purity in the world.</p>

<p>This little message grew out of an address made
before a section of the Women’s Club of the city
and their request to have it published. I have not
changed the literary style from that of public address,
thinking that perhaps it would be more
effective in that form.</p>

<p>You will doubtless find some striking and unusual
statements in this message, but all I ask is
that you will give it careful thought and that you
will remember that these statements have been
made after twenty years of careful study of the
mysteries of life and that they are backed up by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the best of physical and psychic facts. I have not
dared to go into detailed explanation for want of
space and so may bring down on my head storms
that I might easily dissipate if I were but in touch
with the storm maker. But let the storms come if
they must, I will rejoice amidst them all if only I
can awaken the parenthood of this land to the
dangers to which their children are exposed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CLaSH">Child Life and Sex Hygiene</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3><span class="smcap">Sex Hygiene</span></h3>
</div>

<p>This word hygiene has its root in the word
Hygeia. Hygeia was the daughter of one of the
gods of the Classic Mythology, and was the goddess
of health. Sex hygiene is then, sex health,
or sex normality.</p>

<p>Is there special danger of abnormal conditions
or disease in the sex life of children and young
people? We must answer this question before we
can determine whether our time is well spent in
the study which shall follow.</p>

<p>To determine this we must make a brief study
of the unfolding human life and note some of its
component parts and their relative relations and
values in the organism.</p>

<p>We can best do this by a study of <a href="#i_p008">the accompanying
chart</a>. The lower line of the triangle
represents the body, or physical life; the left side
the feelings; the right side the intellect. If body,
feelings and intellect were equal in any human
being, then, we would have a perfect triangle, or a
normal human life. But this is not true in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
child or young person. This diagram illustrates
the relative relations of these three elements of
being as the child advances toward mature life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_p008">
  <img src="images/i_p008.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic">Note—For want of space the triangle is reduced
from original drawing.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The early years of a child’s life is almost purely
physical and the physical plays a large part in
the life of the girl or boy till they are well advanced
in their ’teens, as you will see by a study
of this figure.</p>

<p>Each side of this triangle is three inches long.
The lines that run across the triangle represent
feeling at the various stages of the child’s life.
You can see that in the early years the feelings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the physical are very close together and are the
dominating impulses of the life.</p>

<p>The reader should bear in mind that the word
feeling is not here used in the restricted sense of referring
to physical feelings only, but to all the
feelings which surge through the being from whatever
source. We should not lose sight of the
fact, however, that, because of the important part
that is played in the organism during the teens by
the impulses from a given nerve center, all
feelings will be colored more or less by the outfloodings
of that nerve center. As we have suggested,
the child till well advanced in years is
largely a creature of feeling, and what mind it has
is what may be called a picture mind, or a mind
for seeing things. How easy it will be for all the
feelings of the being to become inoculated with
impurity and place before this picture mind of the
child such distorted views of life as will vitiate
the entire organism! How important it is that a
higher intelligence, that is the father and mother,
create pure, noble and beautiful pictures and place
them before this picture, or seeing mind, of the
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Child’s Life Expressed in Figures</span></h3>

<p>Expressing the life of a child in figures, what do
we find? As you will see, the baby has three
inches of physical, three inches of feeling and but
one-fourth of an inch of intellect. <em>This makes six
inches of physical and feeling pitted against one-fourth
of an inch of intellect.</em> The child of six
years has six inches of physical and feeling and
one-half an inch of intellect. The child of fourteen
has six inches of physical and feeling and but
one inch of intellect. <em>Even at eighteen the proportion
is six inches of physical and feeling and but
two inches of intellect.</em> How striking these proportions
are when we put them in inches.</p>

<p>I would not, however, have you think you can
literally measure a child in yards and inches or
that they will all measure the same, for no two
children develope alike, but in a general way this
scale holds good. While you will find some children
developing the intellect much more rapidly
than others, and more rapidly than is suggested
here, still you will find on the whole that this
scale of relative proportions is not far out of the
way for the average child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I would have you stop for a moment
and get this diagram and relative proportions
well fixed in your minds.</span></p>

<p>Think what these proportions mean and to
what constant danger this child is exposed in developing
sex abnormality if not disease. If an
abnormal sex condition obtains it will surely sooner
or later lead to disease. We may therefore
conclude that our study is worth while and of
priceless value to all young life.</p>

<p>The thoughtful study of this diagram convinces
us beyond a peradventure that <em>there is vast danger
of harmful and perhaps dangerous sex conditions
obtaining without careful and intelligent guiding
in the early life of the child</em>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Six to One</span></h3>

<p>Even at fourteen years of age the proportion of
feeling and physical to intellect is as six to one.
Where have you ever heard of a general who went
out to fight a war with ten thousand men when
his enemy had sixty thousand? He might make
a momentary dash with such a force, but in the
end he would be overcome. Still we allow our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
children to grow up with these odds against them
and we seem to be entirely thoughtless as to the
danger they are in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Melting Power of Thought</span></h3>

<p>Are you asking, why the human organism was
not so constructed that the intellect would always
be the dominant factor in the life? Had this been
done there would be no possibility of the organism
ever coming to perfection, for the impulses that are
sent out from the inner life of man through the
brain at the upper end of the spine are so powerful
and so finely attenuated that they would entirely
destroy the physical body before it has time
to become strong and tense and able to carry them.
<em>If the intellectual impulses of a grown man or
woman were sent through the life of a child the
body would be melted just as the fine wire is by a
heavy voltage of electricity.</em></p>

<p>God was wise in creating this sex nerve center,
or physical brain, by which the organism builds
and paints in glorious beauty and charming grace
the wonderful machine, the human body, and
makes it strong and tense so that when the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
is complete the ego or spirit of man will have a
perfect instrument through which to manifest itself
to the world and perform its mission and live its
life in highest nobleness upon the earth. Because
of these facts <em>God has wisely wrapped the intellectual
faculties of the child within its life, as he
does the rose-buds in the rose-bush, that when
the body work is completed, that crown of all His
creation, the self conscious life of man, may manifest
itself in all its glory through a perfect instrument
and that instrument remain strong and proficient
through the years</em>.</p>

<p>We may add this further suggestion to make
our point clear. In our statement of the slow
growth of the intellect as compared to the other
two elements of being, we are dealing with the
reasoning faculties and not with memory, which is
quite another element and is not dangerous to the
physical development, and may show a marked
unfoldment at quite an early age.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Impulse and Vibration</span></h3>

<p>Having got these relative proportions well in
our minds we may for a brief time give our attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to an important scientific fact which is necessary
to our study. Our lives are entirely controlled
by impulses which originate in various parts
of our personalities. Sometimes the impulse comes
from our bodies; again the feelings are in control,
and at times the memory asserts itself. Then again
the intellect is the dominating factor. <span class="smcap">Of this
we may be sure, from whatever element
of being comes the strongest impulse,
there for the time being is the seat of
government.</span> We are also scientifically certain,
<em>that the more finely attenuated an impulse is,
and the more rapid the vibrations are which carry
such an impulse, the more powerful it is and the
more surely will it prevail over the slower impulses
carried at a lower rate of vibration</em>. A current
of electricity of high voltage will melt a bar
of steel.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Finest Organs—Their Functions</span></h3>

<p>With the above thoughts well fixed in our minds
we are ready to ask, what are the two finest and
most sensitive organs in the human body and those
capable of sending out the finest impulses? There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
is but one answer to this question. 1. The brain,
or mind nerve center. 2. The sex nerve center.
One of these nerve centers, the brain, is the instrument
of the intellect and the other nerve center is
the instrument of feeling, not of base and shameful
feelings, as many people think, but of the most
exquisite and beautiful feelings of which a human
being is capable. <em>As the beautiful thoughts of
man may be distorted into vicious and sinful
things, so may the exquisite feelings which flood
forth from the sex nerve center be debased and distorted
into sins.</em></p>

<p>With these glorious possibilities and purposes
of this nerve center before us, what a horrid nightmare
it is for anyone to think, as some people do,
that this sex nerve center is the organ of humiliation
and shame and is therefore not a proper subject
of conversation in polite society. Nothing can
be farther from the truth than this.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Beauty Impulses</span></h3>

<p>Stop for a moment and think; from whence
come the beautiful impulses, or thoughts <span class="allsmcap">OF HOME,
MOTHERHOOD, FATHERHOOD, LOVE FOR AND</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">PROTECTION OF CHILDREN, THE ART OF HOMEBUILDING
AND HOME ADORNMENT</span>? Come they
not from this very nerve center? Destroy this
nerve center in any young child and its life will
be void of all these glorious impulses.</p>

<p>In place then of this nerve center, or sex organ,
being a blushing, shame-faced spirit that mutins
in the life of humanity, it is <em>the producer of all
highest physical beauty both in the human organism
and in its surroundings</em>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Mind Brain and the Body Brain</span></h3>

<p>May I ask how many of you have ever told
your boys and girls this? Not one of you, because
you never knew it before. You have always
thought that our sense of beauty originated in the
nerve center, which we call the brain. The mind
of man directs, unifies and co-ordinates and should
control these beauty impulses as they flood out into
the being, but they have their origin in the sex
nerve center.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This organ, or nerve center, is the
brain of the purely physical life, as
truly as the gray matter, or nerve center<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></span>
<span class="smcap">at the upper end of the spine</span>, which
we call the brain, <span class="allsmcap">IS THE BRAIN OF THE EGO, OR
INNER LIFE</span>. Through the sex organ, or nerve
center, the physical life in its rarest and most delicate
beauty finds expression, as through the brain
the inner life, or ego, expresses itself in thought and
will.</p>

<p>Do you ask for proof of this somewhat remarkable
statement? Let me answer by asking a question.
When are the birds most beautiful in plumage
and sweetest in song? <span class="smcap">At mating time.</span>
<em>It cannot be said that this is due to intellect, but
upon the other hand it is the natural upflooding of
the beauty impulses from the physical brain, or
sex nerve center.</em></p>

<p>We cannot here enter into the deeper psychological
question involved in this somewhat unusual
statement, that the sex nerve center is the physical
brain, but it must be evident to any thoughtful person
that the statement is not far out of the way, as
is evidenced in its beauty building power in the
lives of the birds. There is an intelligence or consciousness
in this physical brain, but it is not a
self-conscious intelligence, such as functions through
the brain at the upper end of the spine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Because of the above facts and many others
that might be presented, we feel justified in the
statements we have made above.</p>

<p>When we contemplate all this may we not well
pray, <em>Oh, God forgive us our sins of ignorance
and false modesty and help us rightly to appreciate
this, one of Thy greatest gifts to the human race!</em></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Striking Illustration</span></h3>

<p>Let me bring to you an illustration to make
this thought clear. Suppose you could unsex
every child in this city under six years of age;
this would be before the sex nerve center had time
to flood the life with the sense of beauty. Then
build a wall about the city and leave these children
to themselves, simply supplying them with
food and clothing, but keeping away from them,
as far as possible, all human beings, who through
sex impulses were filled with thoughts of beauty.
What would be the results and what kind of a
city would you have here in forty years from now?
There would be little, if any, physical beauty among
these people as they grew up, for they would grow
slatternly or slab-sided, or fat and stuffy, and having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
lost the sense of beauty with their unsexing they
would let the buildings go to decay and the streets
grow up to weeds, and what a dreary waste this
once beautiful city would be!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Who Has Been Teaching the Children?</span></h3>

<p>Though the thought is new to you, do you not
begin to see the truth and beauty of what I have
been saying about this wonderful nerve center, or
brain of the physical life?</p>

<p>What father or mother who may read this has
ever felt it a religious joy to teach their children
the truth about this wonderful gift of God to the
human race?</p>

<p>I am not going to ask you how many of you
were so taught, for I feel very sure none of you
were. Scarcely anyone has ever been taught any
thing right about it, but most, if not all, have been
left to stumble along in the dark, as you and I
were, and if by chance they happened to hit upon
a plan, or stumbled onto knowledge, which enabled
them to live together happily after marriage, well
and good; if not, the great American juggernaut,
the divorce mill, makes another revolution, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
wrecked home and two broken lives are held up to
public gaze, as the result of its deadly work. There
is not the slightest doubt in the mind of the writer
but that a large percent of the divorces of this
country grow out of the absolute ignorance of
young people as to how to live together happily.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Help!</span></h3>

<p>But what shall I say? I do not know how to
teach my children.</p>

<p>A most delightful book, which will put pure,
noble, and instructive words into every parent’s
mouth with which to approach their children from
babyhood till they see them stand at the marriage
altar, is “Four Epochs of Life,” by Elizabeth
Hamilton-Muncie, M. D., Ph. M., Graves Publishing
Co., New York. Let us ever remember
that the education of a child along these lines
should begin as suggested in this charming book,
at a very early age, but it is better late than never,
and if you have neglected your children before
begin now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Physical Brain</span></h3>

<p>Let us return now to this wonderful nerve center,
or brain of the physical life. When does it
begin to send out <em>these finely attenuated beauty
impulses, which must move at very high rates of
vibration</em>?</p>

<p>These impulses which give grace, form, and all
other touches of indescribable charm to the body
of the child.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of its life to some small
degree, and from twelve years of age they begin
to show themselves the dominant impulses of the
life. They rise in the body just like waves of heat
on a summer day. <em>They are flooding every fiber
of the being, giving roundness to the limbs, grace
to the form, drawing beauty lines upon the face,
painting roses in the cheeks, putting sparkles in the
depths of liquid eyes.</em> All of this and more are
these little builders, which we call sex impulses,
doing in the years from twelve to eighteen. Is it
any wonder with all this marvelous work to do,
that like the sculptor who is to make a statue out
of a block of marble, they must take possession of
the body and become the dominant element in it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
The heart, liver, digestive organs, and even the
brain itself are subject to these outflooding impulses
as they work out the beauty of the physical
life.</p>

<p>Turn back to your <a href="#i_p008">chart</a> now and note what a
small part the intellect plays in the life of the girl
or boy between the ages of twelve and eighteen.
Just enough to be a willing servant of the sex
impulses, as they work out the plan of beauty, as
given them by the hand of the Master of all life.
In fact the brain is largely an automaton in this
work, for the ego has not had time <em>to fully lay
through the brain that fine system of telephone
connections and wires by which the brain becomes
a perfect instrument through which the ego or
inner man may reason out the problems of life</em>, so
that up to eighteen there is comparatively little
reasoning ability in the life of children.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Impulses Moving at Rapid Rates of
Vibration</span></h3>

<p>These beauty building impulses are sent out in
such abundance during the teens, that they fairly
cause the body to scintillate, the cheeks to glow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and the eyes to sparkle. Here they come, wave
after wave, <em>like shimmering light upon the mountains,
trooping up through the physical life like
angels of the Eternal, making the body glow with
unspeakable beauty</em>.</p>

<p>They should be guided by the finest and holiest
thought, for <em>they are the elect angels of God to the
physical life of man</em>. But what is done with them?
Oh, sad! The parents have been led to think it
is not quite the thing to talk to their children of
these things and the child has not developed sufficient
brain activity to reason about them and to
understand them and translate them into elements
of beauty and sacred service. Here the young
life stands like a beautiful deer before the on-coming
prairie fire, it feels the tremendous swish of
the flood of feelings and physical life, like the
hissing of the flames behind the deer. If only
the deer can reach the lake for which he pants
and swim out into its cool depths he will be safe;
and if the child could creep, as it were, into the
heart of father or mother and hear glorious, tender,
holy words spoken of this flood of feelings, which
is all so strange to it, and which sweeps up through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
its being like a storm in the forest, and have an
intelligence translate them into God’s own beauty
of life, what a joy it would be!</p>

<p>When I see the mighty army of beautiful youth
standing unprotected and in ignorance of the great
danger before them, with no one to teach them and
the very parents that gave them being, indifferent,
is it any wonder that my heart cries out, Oh, sad?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ignorant Parents—Ruined Children</span></h3>

<p>What usually happens if one of these elfs of
human life has the temerity to speak to father or
mother about these strange impulses? A blush of
shame, perhaps, and the expression, “You better
be thinking of something else,” or “You should be
ashamed to be talking of such things,” ends the
conversation.</p>

<p>A lady in high station said to the writer, when
talking upon this subject, “I went to my mother a
few days before my marriage and asked her to
tell me about the marriage state. My mother was
a good woman, but all she said was, ‘You will
find out soon enough.’” God forgive and pity the
ignorance of such mothers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Rebuffed at home, what happens? This child
goes out upon the streets and from vulgar playmates,
older than it is, through vulgar stories and
suggestions, gets a base and lewd conception of
all this in his or her life which God meant for
beauty, for His glory and the glory of the race, or
what is almost as bad, remains in stupid and dangerous
ignorance till some vile octopus throws his
tentacles about this dream of beauty and sparkling,
buoyant youth, and the end of the tragedy is a
ruined life, or what more often happens, two of
these ignorant young people get together and because
of their ignorance commit those acts against
chastity which bring ruin and disgrace.</p>

<p>“But,” you say, “such cases as you depict
above are the exception and not the rule and I am
not afraid of my child being caught in such ways.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Your Child Is Not Safe</span></h3>

<p>I grant you this and hope by all means it is so.
But do not because of this, settle back into comfortable
indifference, for there are greater dangers
than those stated above from which you cannot
say your children are so free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>As children grow up in the home, if it is a right
home, they often see father and mother kiss each
other, and perhaps they see the mother sometimes
lovingly drop down upon the lap of father and
put her arms about his neck. The natural question
that comes to the mind of the child is, “why
does she do that?” No one has ever taken the
trouble to anticipate this unspoken question and
answer it, and the child goes out to mingle with
its playmates of both sexes with this unspoken question
unanswered.</p>

<p>The natural outcome of the child reasoning will
be, if one woman can kiss a man and sit upon his
lap, then all women can kiss men and sit upon their
laps. Why not reason in this way? No one has
ever taken the trouble to explain the difference between
the married and the unmarried state and
the rights and privileges that belong to the wedded
pair, which rights are recognized by both God and
the laws of our land.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Natural Mating</span></h3>

<p>If you will observe them, children mate as naturally
as the birds do. Here they are dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
about us like the sunbeams in the forest, in pairs
of natural selection. You may notice them in the
home, in the school and on the streets. Innocent
little things they are in these childish matings and
might remain so to the end of life if some kind
intelligence were directing them. But no such intelligence
is at hand. The mothers joke about these
matings and tease the children about them and that
is the end of the parents’ relation to this gravest
question in all life.</p>

<p>These children grow to fourteen or fifteen years
of age and the impulses from the sex nerve center
begin to flood themselves out in a perfect submergence
of the life. They get hold of some silly love
stories, that have been written by some heartless
person for so much per line, and were never intended
for any normal person to believe or think
possible, but to their childish minds it is a chapter
from real life, for they are not in any sense normal
beings at this age as you will see by a look at the
triangle. At this age <em>the intelligence is but a mere
pigmy</em> in their lives as compared to the giants of
feeling and physical life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ignorance Brings Ruin</span></h3>

<p>Seeing and knowing no danger in it, they follow
out the natural sex impulse to touch one another
and to caress each other. Why not? Have
they not read in the love story of the lover and
the sweetheart kissing and caressing each other,
and furthermore, and <em>the strongest possible evidence
in the case, have they not seen father and
mother kiss and caress each other</em>? Is it not the
most natural thing, under these conditions, for these
children to enter into such familiar relations as will
lead to serious consequences in many cases?</p>

<p>I know many a girl has lived through this
period of ignorant familiarity with young men without
having her character wholly ruined, and she
appears before those of us who know the danger
through which she has passed, as a living miracle.</p>

<p>But having escaped these dangers herself, what
has she done for the young man with whom she
has had these familiar relations? She has, unwittingly
of course, multiplied the sex impulses in his
life till they sweep over him like a fire in the forest.
He is a manly young fellow and would scorn the
thought even of allowing these impulses to expend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
themselves upon the one who had awakened them
and increased their outflooding. In the midst of
these experiences he falls in with some young man
older than himself, and they talk it over. This
fellow prides himself on being worldly wise, and
so the younger man is influenced by him. The
result is that he goes to someone who will receive
him for a money consideration. Then comes the
awful awakening, and he recognizes the fact, that
the blighting leprosy of the sin of lewdness has
fastened itself upon him. But after the first shock
his heart is lightened, because some physician assures
him that he can cure him. But that man is
either ignorant or he is wilfully deceiving this
young man, for the Almighty himself cannot assure
him that this plague will ever entirely leave
his body. God will forgive his soul, but no one
can honestly assure him that his body is not damned
for all time. It is true some men seem to recover
entirely, but no one can give them any assurance
in this matter. The best medical science tells us
that these germs may remain in the body for years
and then show themselves in various forms and diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Is it not time for those of us who know of the
awfulness of this dread plague to “cry aloud from
the housetops,” if by chance we may awaken the
fathers and mothers who sleep in ignorance and
false modesty?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Appalling Instance</span></h3>

<p>Will it help you any if I tell you of a single instance,
which came under my notice some time
ago, and is but one out of many that chills my
blood as I write. A young girl came to a certain
city and secured employment in one of the business
houses of the city. She was of inferior intellect
and had but little chance for development of
that side of her nature, but the sex brain, or
nerve center, had done much for her and built in
her body lines of remarkable grace, had painted
her cheeks with marvelous color and given unusual
brilliancy to her eyes. A foul miscreant,
in the form of a man of older years, saw this
beautiful human creature and decoyed her into improper
relations with him. His body was full of
the leprosy of lewdness and he imparted it to
this ignorant young creature. But sad as it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
be it would not be so bad if the tragedy had
stopped there, but it did not. Think of it friends!
<span class="smcap">Eight of the untaught and unprotected
boys of the High School of that city,
who had been allowed the freedom of
kisses and embraces of young girls, as
ignorant and unprotected as they</span>, saw
this young creature and were drawn into improper
relations with her and the leprosy was passed on
to each of them. This is not an illustration merely,
but a statement of fact, for I had the facts
direct from the physicians who treated these boys.</p>

<p>If this was your High School would you be
alarmed? And would you cast aside your false
modesty and in the name of God be frank and
true to your children?</p>

<p>Though it may not be your High School there
are always dangers enough that if realized should
make parents earnest and anxious for the safety of
their loved ones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ignorance and a Wrecked Home</span></h3>

<p>May I give you a single illustration of the
wrecking of two lives, through the ignorance of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
boy touching these grave questions? This sad
story was told me by a medical friend, who was
personally acquainted with these young people,
and while an interne in a hospital, in one of our
eastern cities, assisted in the operation referred to.</p>

<p>A young boy of sixteen, of one of the refined
and cultured families of the city, had grown up
in ignorance as to sex relations and instincts. He
was invited to a week-end party, at the home of
friends, and while there, with a houseful of guests,
fell in with a woman older than himself, who
enticed him into improper relations with her.
Whether she knew it or not, she was afflicted with
the leprosy of lewdness and she passed it on to this
boy. As soon as he discovered his condition he
went to his father and told him about this incident
and was taken to one of the best physicians in this
country, who lived in the city. This physician
treated the young man till he was twenty-four
years old and assured him, so far as medical science
could determine, he seemed to be entirely cured.
The young man had become awakened by this
sad experience and through this awakening learned
of the awful fatality which attaches itself to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
leprosy, so to be sure he went to another specialist
and was examined and treated by him for a
year. During these years, between the ages of
sixteen and twenty-five, he had fallen in love with
a beautiful young woman of one of the refined
homes of the city; but so much of dread had he
that he deferred his marriage for a year to make
sure that the last vestige of the plague was gone.
At last they were married with all the joys and
delights of that hour.</p>

<p>Vain hope was his, for in less than a year after
their marriage the physicians were compelled to
perform an operation to save the young woman’s
life, which forever left that home childless and
the young husband carrying in his heart an awful
shadow which would never lift till the grave received
him.</p>

<p>This is not an isolated case, for such tragedies
are multiplied by thousands all over this fair land
of ours. And the appalling facts are that a large
majority of them can be charged to a lack of education
by the parents. Thousands of dollars are
spent to educate the children in books and music,
but not a moment of time given to teach them the
truth about this one most important subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Aroused Soul</span></h3>

<p>Are you startled and does your heart cry out,
“What can I do? Oh! what can I do?”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Helper</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">You can be frank, intelligent and
human with your children.</span> Let me tell
you, if I may, some things you can do. Let us
think of the daughter first, but not because she
needs more protection than the son, for God
knows they are both in need of all the protection
loving, intelligent parents can give them.</p>

<p>If the streets are sloppy and you want to protect
your daughter, what do you advise her? To
wear her rubbers, of course. If she has a cold
and there is a raw wind blowing what do you advise
her? Wrap up well and see that her throat
is protected. Why do you give this advice? Because
on the sloppy streets the feet are the points
of attack, and in the raw wind the throat is the
point of attack.</p>

<p>Why not be just as sane in dealing with your
daughter when you come to teach her to protect
her character and self respect?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>At what points do these outflooding impulses
of glorious womanhood manifest themselves at
the surface of the body? The answer is self-evident,
the lips and the bosom. You have known
this all the time and you have sat idly by and
seen your daughters go out into dangers far more
deadly than wet feet or inflamed throat without
ever saying a word to them about how to protect
themselves. Why not sit down by your daughter
of fourteen and tell her these truths; tell her there
is a vital connection between the bosom and the
sex nerve center which is more sensitive than the
most delicate electric impulse and explain to her
how wonderfully God has arranged the body of
woman and why? Why not tell her the same truth
as to her lips? <em>Tell her that unless God had
made a vital connection between the lips of a
woman and the sex nerve center she could not kiss
love and nobleness into the life of her children during
those glorious days of motherhood.</em> Tell her,
with all the love a mother can put into the words,
that will live forever in the heart of every true
child, that because of these wonderful truths every
<em>true young woman should protect her lips and</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
<em>bosom as she would the engagement ring, the pledge
of love and approaching marriage</em>. Tell her, with
the wifely love upflooding from your heart, why
her father has a right to kiss and embrace you and
<em>why it will mean the lowering of her character, if
not its ultimate loss, for her to give these jewels of
hers, even for a moment, into the hands of any
man other than he who will be her husband, and
as such has the loving right to them</em>.</p>

<p>Why not teach your son the sacredness of
womanhood and the manliness of protecting it?
Pardon me, if I say I am not writing a theory, but
am speaking out of my own heart. I commenced
teaching my own son when he was twelve years
old and had my last talk with him a month before
he was married. He grew up to be a clean young
man and I felt a thousand times repaid for my
effort when his wife came to her new mother a
short time after their marriage and told her with
such delight how thoughtful, kind, gentle and refined
her lover was in all their relations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Dance and Its Dangers</span></h3>

<p>I may at this point call attention to the dangers
of the dance. Every girl who enjoys dancing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
and most of them do, should be shown the dangers
to both herself and the man in allowing herself to
be drawn up too close to the person of the man
she is dancing with. She should not only be told
that she must not do so, but told plainly and lovingly
why. There may be nothing impure in the
thought of either, for when they are dancing they
are usually not thinking. Music tends to quiet
thought and under such conditions they will follow
the sex impulse and unconsciously draw near to
each other, and they are far more sure to do so
while ignorant of the dangers in it. In like manner
boys should be taught to carefully respect the person
of girls and told in a plain, frank way the
truth about their relations to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>I believe, as a rule young people love to dance
with the purest of motives. They are attracted
to this form of amusement because of their love
for music and the natural desire to keep time to it.
The most zealous religionist finds himself patting
his foot when a bit of lively music is played, which
is but an evidence of the natural desire of any
human being to keep time to music.</p>

<p>Is there someone asking, “If it is true that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
young people have the purest of motives in their
desire to dance, how comes it then that so many
frightful mistakes are made as a result of the
dance?” I might answer in a single word, by
saying, <span class="smcap">Ignorance</span>.</p>

<p>It is the conviction of the writer, however, that
no more mistakes are made in proportion, and perhaps
not so many, as the result of the dance as by
long night rides in buggies, or sitting in the shadow
of trees in public parks. But the facts are more
people dance than ride in buggies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Psychology of the Dance</span></h3>

<p>The great danger in the dance is, to my mind,
<em>a psychological one</em>, which might be overcome by
knowledge upon the subject. Let us examine this
thought for a time, for here is the crux of the
whole matter. When your attention is called to
it, you cannot think of more perfect relations
existing between two persons for hypnosis, or hypnotic
suggestion to take place than that which
exists in the dance. To get this clearly before us
let us note the steps taken by the hypnotist. He
has his subject relax his body, and put his mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
at rest and then he prefers to have soft music
played. Under these conditions he most easily
gets control of the mind of his subject.</p>

<p>Let us now study the couple dancing. The
body must be in a more or less relaxed state, for
graceful motion would not be possible with a rigid
body. The mind is at rest, because the music lulls
it into quiet and makes the dominant element in
the life the feelings, for <em>we do not think music,
we feel it</em>. Just here you must recall, that the
sex nerve center is the brain of the physical life
and continually sends forth the most exquisite impulses
of feeling, which manifest themselves in all
the glory and beauty of bodily charm and these
<em>must of necessity mingle in their outgoings with the
vibrations of the music and the feelings which it
induces</em>.</p>

<p>Now you have these two persons, <em>with bodies
relaxed, minds at rest, just floating over the floor,
and carried, as it were, on waves of music</em>. Under
just these conditions many an uninstructed and
ignorant girl has passed under a hypnotic spell in
which she has been led to do that which ruined
her life and which she would have surrendered her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
life rather than have done, had she been in her
normal state.</p>

<p>Let me give you an instance in point. Some
years ago I was lecturing on the psychic question,
and among other things I spoke of <em>the psychology
of the dance</em>. The next morning I met one of the
fine, clean young men of the little city, who was
teller in one of the banks. He said to me, “Doctor
I enjoyed your lecture very much last night,
and I believe you have the right idea as to the
psychology of the dance.” He said, “Sometime
ago I was dancing with one of the finest young
ladies in this city, one who is absolutely above
reproach. As you said, ‘we were just floating
along over the floor charmed by the music.’ I was
looking down at her (he was a tall man), and
thinking what a nice young woman she was, when
all at once she laid her face against mine. She
did not excuse herself then and she has not apologized
since and I do not believe she knew that
she did it.” This is the conclusion of a sane,
thoughtful young man, as he pondered over an unusual
experience with a pure-minded and irreproachable
young woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>May I here give the testimony of an educated,
thoughtful young man of thirty? In a frank talk
with me, he said: “There have been a few times
in my life when I have found it necessary to stop
dancing with certain ladies.”</p>

<p>There might not have been the slightest wrong
thought in the minds of this young man or the
lady he was dancing with, but the outflooding
impulses from the sex nerve center in the life of the
lady might just at that time have been so vital and
have been carried at such rapid rates of vibration
as to make themselves felt in the atmosphere about
her. This, my friends, might happen <em>without an
evil thought upon the part of either, for this brain
of the physical life may and does send out these
impulses without the recognition of the intellect</em>.</p>

<p>Had this young man observed these ladies he
would have noted a charming and unusual color
of the skin of the face and an unusual and bewitching
sparkle in the eyes, both of which indicate
marked activity of the sex brain, or nerve
center.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Should the Dance Be Abolished?</span></h3>

<p>There are many good people who would like
to abolish the dance, and because of the ignorance
of the larger number of people who engage
in this amusement, I think I would join with them,
but in all probability we will never be able to do it,
so long as people love music and instinctively keep
time to it.</p>

<p>It may be in our zeal in this matter we are
making a mistake and taking a wrong view of the
question and by vicious, and sometimes senseless,
attacks upon many good young people and this
particular form of amusement in which they engage,
doing both them and ourselves an injustice
and keeping many of them out of the Kingdom.
Of this I am sure, if young people are to dance
<em>they should have proper chaperonage and a right
knowledge of the possible dangers and how to
avoid them</em>. <span class="smcap">No greater mistake could be
made than to allow young people to attend
public dances.</span></p>

<p>May I close this little message then, which goes
out with a prayer for God’s blessings to rest upon
all who read it, that it may be a helpful message<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to them; by urging frankness and candor upon the
part of you, the parents, with your children, and if
you are uninstructed inform yourselves and put such
books in the hands of your children as will give
them pure, wholesome information upon this most
important subject in all the world, and God will
bless you and them, and in joy and thankfulness
you will see them grow up in the purity and nobleness
of strong, helpful men and women. <span class="smcap">Be
assured of this, if you do not educate
them the streets will.</span></p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
